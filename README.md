👋 Hi, I’m @Rainey107577

👀 I’m interested in AI research, ethical hacking, and community-driven projects that push the boundaries of technology and human interaction.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques, ethical hacking, and community management. I'm also on a mission to delve deep into video production and mastering Spanish.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that leverage AI for social good, as well as projects that can benefit from my unique perspective shaped by a rich and diverse life journey.
📫 How to reach me: You can DM me here on GitHub or reach out via my Discord server where I'm running a cutting-edge AI-driven simulation project.
